Dear RELATIVE,
I am having a(n) ADJECTIVE time at camp. The counselour is ADJECTIVE and the food is ADJECTIVE.
I met NAME and we became ADJECTIVE friends. Unfortunately, NAME is ADJECTIVE and I VERB my BODY PART so we couldn`t
go VERB like everybody else. I need more NOUN and a NOUN sharpener, so please ADVERB VERB more when you VERB back.
Your RELATIVE,
PERSON IN ROOM
